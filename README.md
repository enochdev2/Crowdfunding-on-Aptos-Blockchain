# Move crowdfunding smart contract

## Goal 
The goal of this project is to port a crowdfunding smart contract from Solidity to Move and research the workflow and programming logic that is needed to achieve this. 


## Files
- The ported smart contract can be found in [CrowdFunding.move](sources/CrowdFunding.move)
- Tests developed to test the different features of the contract can be found in [CrowdFundingTests.move](tests/CrowdFundingTests.move)
